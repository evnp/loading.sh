loading.sh has no external dependencies, but it's good practice to audit code before downloading.sh onto your system to ensure it contains nothing unexpected. Please view the full source code for loading.sh here: https://github.com/evnp/loading.sh/blob/master/loading.sh

If you also want to install loading.sh's man page:
```sh
read -rp $'\n'"Current \$MANPATH:"$'\n'"${MANPATH//:/ : }"$'\n\n'"Enter a directory from the list above: " \
  && curl -L -o "${REPLY/\~/$HOME}/man1/loading.sh.1" https://github.com/evnp/loading.sh/raw/main/man/loading.sh.1
```

```sh
loading.sh -v
